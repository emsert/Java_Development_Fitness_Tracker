Purpose of the Project: 
Creating a program that assists individuals in tracking and maintaining their health. This project will be able to cater to a wide range of individuals of any age. The program will take the user’s statistics, such as height, weight, and age, and output different health information to the user. Some of the outputs would include if the user is overweight, how many calories the individual should consume, how much water the individual should drink, and much more. The program will also include fitness logs, so the user is able to keep track of daily health statistics. In addition, the program will inform the user on what they need to do in order to reach their target weights. This could include telling the user they need to exercise more or eat less. Overall, we want the user to be able to use this program to become healthier and reach their target weight goals. 

Why is the project important?
Unfortunately, the obesity rate in the United States is quite high. Vast majority of the population eat fast-food. There are some reasons why this type of food is being consumed a lot. It is relatively cheap to have a fast food meal. In addition, it is quite efficient for the ones who do not have a lot of time to spend for their meals. We would like to help those out by providing a fitness source, which the users can put their input to get valuable feedback. The information they receive can assist them change their eating habits as well as exercising routine to become healthy individuals. Furthermore, the reason the project is important is that most of the people cannot or do not maintain the weight they desire and that might cause health problems, but no worries! We are here to help to those who are willing to get assistance. Finally, more than one third of the U.S. adult population is considered as obese; however, we believe that this concept will be the ultimate solution on those who are seeking to change their lives for better.

Cases: 
1. The first case we will have will be for calories. In this case we will use the health information, given to us by the user, and determine how many calories they should be in taking on a daily basis. Also, in this case we will allow the user to input their caloric intake values from the day. This will be kept in a log for the user to see so they can track what they have eaten and how much they have eaten as well. This will be useful because the user will be able to compare how much he has eaten to the stated amount they should be eating.
2. The second case will be excersise. This portion of the program will also give the user a set number of minutes that they should be exercising a day. This portion will also feature a log entry for the user to track their fitness levels. The user can enter in what types of exercises they did in addition to how many reps they did. By entering in their exercises, they can compare the amount of reps they have increased by. This will be helpful for the user so they can compare their fitness levels on a week to week basis. 
3. The third case of hour program will be water intake. This portion of the program would recommend the amount that the user should be drinking based on their height, weight, and activity level. This is important because staying hydrated is crucial during any fitness activity and also it is important to drink water on a daily basis. Drinking the recommended amount of water improves the health of an individual. By having water intake in our program, it helps the user develop a health lifestyle by drinking the correct amount of water each day. 
4. The last case is sleep. Recharging your body after a long day is important. Sleep rests not only your mind, but your muscles as well. This part of the program will allow the user to enter in a sleep log to track the amount of sleep they are receiving each night. They can enter in the different types of sleep they had such as restless or uninterrupted sleep. They then can compare the amount of sleep they receive to the recommended average which will also be stated in the program. This part of the program is important because sleep deprivation can cause serious health issues in an individual and hour program will help the user recognize if they are getting enough sleep at night. 

Foreseen Limitations:
Some limitations good include the vast range of health issues that individuals have that might alter the amount of food, water, and exercise they have. These people will be outliers to our program because they may not fall within the boundaries of the equation. Catering to individuals with different health issues would be difficult because there are so many different health issues an individual could have. Also, there could be problems programming the different cases as well.  A large portion of our cases have activity logs within them; therefore, we must learn how to develop and program a log feature for our program. Another limitation our group faces is the lack of time our group members have to meet in person with one another. We must actively communicate with one another and make sure we make time to meet for the project, so we are on the same page with the various functions and aspects of the project. Communicating is going to be crucial in this project as well as time management.
